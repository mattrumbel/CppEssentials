DESCRIPTION
This assignment aims to letting practice with references and points. This assignment also needs STL and I/O. Note that the given files have a special file called Makefile. The purpose of Makefile is guiding the process on how to build (compile and link) the C++ code. The file looks a little mysterious. Don't worry about it for now. For the moment, you don't need to write Makefile yourself. Sometime in the future, you may need to.

In the first part of the assignment, we practice "references" first.

Here, you need to write a function

buildList 
that receives an STL list and populates the list with a sequence of words read from standard input (cin). The function should return nothing and modify the list it receives. When the input ends (end-of-file, i.e., CTRL-D), end the reading and return the constructed list.

The main program must simply call upon your buildList function and dump the list of words it receives on the standard output, one word per line.

Make sure that you make use of const annotations whenever appropriate.

For example, suppose you type in two lines in the standard input:

 

This is my

code programs.

 

Then, buildList would construct a STL list of strings with:

This is my code programs.

Then it outputs each word one by one in the standard output:

This

is

my

code

programs.
