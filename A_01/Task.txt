DESCRIPTION
You are given an array of srings. You want to code a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst this array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

For example, suppose the input array of strings is: ["flower","flow","flight"]. Then the output of the function is:: "fl". As another example, suppose the input is: ["dog","racecar","car"]. Then the output is: "". That is, there is no common prefix among the input strings.

More specificly, your task is implementing a function (as shown in the header file: ECLongestPrefix.h):

std::string ECLongestPrefix(int numStrings, const std::string *arrayStrings[]);

Submit C++ source:

1. ECLongestPrefix.cpp - with Solution implemented as part of homework.

2. ECLongestPrefixTest.cpp - Same as Student starter code.

3. ECLongestPrefix.h - Same as Student starter code.
